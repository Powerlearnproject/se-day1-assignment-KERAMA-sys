Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering involves the design, development,testing, implementation, deployment and maintenance of software products. It plays a crucial role by enabling the creation of software products that power various systems in our world today such as communication, healthcare, entertainment and finance
- 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages such C
- establishment of software engineering and structural programming
- rise of agile methodologies 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements - gathering of user and system documents
- Design - creating detailed designs of the software structure and interface
- Implementation - writing code and building the software as per the design specifications 
- Testing - tests are done to ensure quality standards and functionality of the system are met
- Deployment - releasing system to users or customers
- Maintenance - providing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall is sequential while agile is interactive
- Waterfall is rigid to change while agile is flexible, allows for continous improvement. example of agile is AI/Machine learning 
- Waterfall is defined in phases while agile is continuous
- In waterfall methodology testing is done after deployment while in agile testing is done during the development stages. Example is in cloud computing which requires constant updates
  

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer - writes code and implement software solutions
- Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures quality software products by designing and testing them
- Project Manager - Oversee planning, execution and delivery of software products 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

-IDEs enhances productivity like code completion, syntax highlighting and error detection for example Visual Studio code
-IDEs encourages automation
- VCS encourages collaboration that enables multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other's code example is GitHub


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- changing requirements. this can be overcome through adoption of agile methodologies,defining clear and prioritized requrirements and use of prototyping 
- tight deadlines. this can be overcome through priortization of tasks and reassessment of timelines
- technical debts. can be overcome by monitoring and tracking debt and communicating with stakeholders

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing - testing individual components or modules. Importance. Debugging and improves code quality
- Integration Testing - testing interations between different components. Importance. Ensures module compatibility and detects data flow errors
- System testing - Testing entire system as a whole. Importance ensures security and compliance
- Acceptance testing - testing software against user requirements to ensure it meet user needs. Importance. Ensures businesses goals are met and increases user satisfaction

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt Engineering is all about crafting statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It is important as it provides clear and specific answers 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague prompt 'Tell me about Kenya'
- Improved prompt ' Tell me about the history of Kenya'
- the improved prompt is effective as it gives you a more indepth response as to that of vague prompt
